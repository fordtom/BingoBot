This project is a python-based discord bot, designed to serve a single, small server. The bot runs from a uv-based python 3.12 install inside a docker container on a separate machine. A single directory (/data) is mounted to the container that points to a shared drive on our NAS.

When writing code, always think first about neatness and conciseness, as well as modularity and maintainability.
